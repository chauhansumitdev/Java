 * Problem:
 * Given two sorted linked lists, merge them into a single sorted linked list.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * List 1: 1 -> 3 -> 5
 * List 2: 2 -> 4 -> 6
 * Output:
 * Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
 * 
 * Note:
 * - The input lists are sorted in ascending order.
 * - The merged list should also be sorted in ascending order.
 * - The input lists may have different lengths.
 * - The input lists may be empty.
